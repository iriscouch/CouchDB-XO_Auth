External OAuth Authentication for CouchDB
=========================================

This is a rewrite of the couchdb-facebook authentication module in a more generic manner allowing other systems (e.g. Twitter) to be easily added. In addition the code is designed to utilise the _\_users_ database in a similar manner to the CouchDB 1.2 OAuth code allowing a single user to be authenticated in a number of different ways. Because of this change, this code is NOT COMPATIBLE with the couchdb-facebook code.

This version has been tested against CouchDB 1.2.x

This initial implementation adds a Facebook authentication module that uses the
[Facebook authentication API](http://developers.Facebook.com/docs/authentication/ ) to log people in.

It consists of a CouchDB httpd\_global\_handler that responds to http GET requests and
processes the Facebook login sequence. Once logged in, the handler requests an access
code and retrieves the Facebook profile information via https://graph.Facebook.com/me. The user's Facebook ID can
then be used to retrieve the CouchDB users document from the authentication_db to create the CouchDB session. The access code is stored
in the user record. If there isn't a matching user record then one is created using the Facebook ID as the username

An error during Facebook login will return HTTP 403 to the original caller. 

Example Flow of Control
---------------------------
 
For our example we assume the app is hosted at my_site.com

1. The browser requests the link:
   https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=249348058430770&scope=user_about_me&redirect_uri=http:%2F%2Fmy_site.com:5984%2F_fb
2. The user logs into Facebook (if not already logged in) and approves the app (if
not already approved). NOTE: If the user was already logged in and has already approved the app then
they will be redirected back to your app without needing to type anything.
4. The browser arrives back at the _\_fb with a code that allows this module
to contact Facebook via the API and request an Access Code. No user interaction
required.
5. Once the Access Code is granted it allows the module to retrieve the users ID and other details from 
Facebook. A couchDB username is created and the ID along with the access token is stored. Storing
the access token allows server components to access Facebook on the user's behalf.
6. When the couch session expires (the app will have to catch this) you simply
need to send the user to the URL in (1) again and, because they've already gone thru this
route, it should get you all the way back to _\_fb without any user
interaction needed.
7. The final act is to redirect the user to into the app, a location that is
a combination of _client\_app\_uri_ config directive and the _clientapptoken_
param to _\_fb_.


Build
--------------------

Use Build CouchDB: https://github.com/iriscouch/build-couchdb

    rake plugin='git://github.com/iriscouch/CouchDB-XO_Auth origin/master'

Installation
-------------------

Build CouchDB performed the installation already.

Next, create a [Facebook app](http://developer.facebook.com).

Configuration
--------------------

See the Futon configuration section, under the `fb` section.

**\_fb**  
  This is the couch location for the code that redirects the user to Facebook.
  Pass in a param called _clientapptoken_ if you want something added to the
  client app redirect at the end of the auth process (for when control is
  returned to your app).

  NOTE: Facebook requires that your site is public. The 'Site URL' setting of
        the Facebook app needs to be set to your site.
        
**client_id**  
  The App ID of your Facebook app

**store_access_token**
  This defaults to false. Setting it to true means that the user's Access Token will be saved in
  the \_user database allowing server components to access the user's external account
  
**redirect_uri**  
  This is the location that Facebook will be told to return the user to when
  Facebook login is complete. This MUST start with the same location that you set
  for Site URL in the Facebook app

**client\_secret**  
  DO NOT PUBLISH THIS! It is the _App Secret_ from your Facebook app.
  It is used behind the scenes to contact Facebook. If anyone gets hold
  of this they can pretend to be your app. Beware!

**client\_app\_uri**  
  Once the Facebook and CouchDB login have completed this is the URL that the initial call
  will be redirected to. Any value passed to the initial _\_fb__ call param _clientapptoken_ will be
  appended to this URL.

Notes
---------------

The users ID on the external system and the access token are stored in the user document in the authenticatio database as follows:

    {
       "_id": "org.couchdb.user:michaelcollins14795",
       "_rev": "1-2eb00e9f166c13d63a6479144a3f565e",
       "salt": "421209aaee82b479d5799ca2a51d2ff4",
       "facebook": {
           "id": "555366654",
           "access_token": "AAABriRugmO4BAONugCLvNsaV3JN5OwZB5Aw85S5OEHLlYkC8taqFtVM0ZABSvrFZA0u3h1Jd0sGq3ybITF3wXkfMffppsEZD"
       },
       "name": "michaelcollins14795",
       "roles": [
       ],
       "type": "user"
    }

Adding a section to an existing user document that contains the *facebook* section with the ID and a blank access_token would allow that user to be authenticated via Facebook.
